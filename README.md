"introduction" 
------------------
Cardiovascular diseases stay the leading cause of death globally). Early detection of the symptoms is important to prevent the disease from fully developing and reduce premature mortality. Classic heart attacks are characterised by severe chest pain and pressure, pain in the arm, neck or jaw. But nearly half of heart attacks are described as "silent": they lack most typical symptoms or have symptoms that you don't recognize as a sign of a heart disease. Silent heart attacks are more common among women and described by such symptoms as shortness of breath, fatigue and nausea.
